This is a fork of Tom Harrington's (@atomicbird) [DemoNotes](https://github.com/atomicbird/iOS-Extension-Demo) demonstrating how to instrument Amplitude's [iOS SDK](https://github.com/amplitude/amplitude-ios) with extensions.

We have instrumented the [Share to Note](https://github.com/amplitude/iOS-Extension-Demo/blob/master/Share%20to%20Note/ShareViewController.m) extension to log events to Amplitude.
